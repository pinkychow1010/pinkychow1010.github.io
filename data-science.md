This page is to serve as a general overview of the standalone data science projects I've worked on apart from my work. All of these projects are in Python and R.

## **Kaggle**

- [**Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification**](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/EfficientNet-rice-disease-detection)
  - Classification challenge on rice paddy images where different dieseases were the class of interest. I spent most of my time on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and used a deep learning model built on EfficientNet for my submission, where classification accuracy on validation and testing data ranges from 97% to 98%.

- [**Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Identification**]()
  - Identify whales and dolphins by unique characteristics
  

## **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

- [Clustering](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/clustering-active-fire-detection)
  - Active Fire clustering.
 

## **Visualizations**

- [Geospatial]()
  - Visualized geospatial data using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and folium.


## **Spatial Modelling**

- [Home Range Analysis](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/HomeRangeAnalysis)

- [SDM]()

## **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- [Digital Chinese History](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/digital-chinese-history-blog)
  - Chinese Text Analysis

## **Dashboard**

- [Data Dashboard](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/HomeRangeAnalysis)
  - Created a geospatial dashboard using flexdashboard generate visualizations for Gorillas' home range.

## **Image Processing**

- [Snow Cover Product]()
  - Developed a snow classification scheme on long-term AVHRR satellite data with spatial and temporal filters
  - Integration test using pytest

- [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/Burkina_Faso_Inland_Water_Bodies_Time_Series)
