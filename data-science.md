This page is to serve as a general overview of the standalone data science projects I've worked on apart from my work. All of these projects are in Python and R.

## **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

- [**Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification**](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/EfficientNet-rice-disease-detection)
  - Classification challenge on rice paddy images where different dieseases were the class of interest. I spent most of my time on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and used a deep learning model built on EfficientNet for my submission, where classification accuracy on validation and testing data ranges from 97% to 98%. Written in Keras.

- [**Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Identification**](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/CNN-whale-fin-identification)
  - Identify whales and dolphins by unique characteristics


## **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

- [Clustering](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/clustering-active-fire-detection)
  - Active Fire clustering.


## **Data Processing**

- [Locust Outbreak Prediction](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/DeepLearning_LocustPrediction)
  - Predict locust swarm from climate time series


## **Visualizations**

- [Geospatial](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/Burkina_Faso_Inland_Water_Bodies_Time_Series)
  - Visualized geospatial data using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and folium.


## **Spatial Modelling**

- [Home Range Analysis](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/HomeRangeAnalysis)

- [SDM]()

## **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- [Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/disaster-tweets)

- [Digital Chinese History Blog](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/digital-chinese-history-blog)
  - Chinese Text Analysis


## **Dashboard**

- [Data Dashboard](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/HomeRangeAnalysis)
  - Created a geospatial dashboard using flexdashboard generate visualizations for Gorillas' home range.


## **Image Processing**

- [Snow Cover Product](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/dlr_snow_class)
  - Developed a snow classification scheme on long-term AVHRR satellite data with spatial and temporal filters
  - Integration test using pytest

- [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/Priestley_Glacier_GNSS_Positioning_Assessment)

- [Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/PhuQuoc_OpenDumping)
