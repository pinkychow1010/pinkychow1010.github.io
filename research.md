### **Machine Learning-based Locust Swarm Prediction in Ethiopia**

#### Final Poster Submission for ESA Living Planet Symposium 2022

Locust invasion has frequently caused huge economic losses and threatened food security in the North African countries. This project aims to integrate long-term and short-term hydroclimatic variables (FEWS NET Land Information System and WorldClim) and multispectral reflectance (Landsat) into machine learning models for locust plague prediction in Ethiopia. 

I trained multiple models using data records from FAO Locust Hub and remote sensing imagery between 1998 and 2005, yielding optimal accuracy of 88.4%. The results are presented as a research poster at the ESA Living Planet Symposium 2022.

### **Snow Cover classification algorithms for European Alps**

#### Methodology applied for research project

To understand the snowline elevation dynamics in the European Alps, remote sensing data can be applied by first building a snow cover classifier. In this project, I independently developed a novel classifier and the data pipeline for the long-term Landsat time series, yielding significant improvements in the classification results for all Landsat sensors. 

The algorithms are applied in the research study, published in the research journal MDPI. More details are available in the [project page](https://pinkychow1010.github.io/project/2021/10/01/snowline.html).

### **Global SnowPack for VIIRS sensor**

#### Software module applied for research project

</div>

Global SnowPack is a data product developed by the DLR with global coverage, providing MODIS-based information about long-term snow cover changes. This project aims to develop a software module to integrate data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument into the product, with a systematic evaluation of the potential compatibility of both datasets. 

The project details are available [here](https://pinkychow1010.github.io/project/2022/09/01/gsp.html). The results are planned to be published in a research journal.
