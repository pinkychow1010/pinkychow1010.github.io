Earth observation and cloud computing allow fast and cost-effective analyses of urban risks, revealing significant impacts caused by the changing climate. Despite tons of satellite data being freely available, the programming and computational requirements are challenging for scholars from other fields to apply the data. For many, analysis-ready data can be helpful. 

To fill this gap, I developed an [interface](https://sites.google.com/view/intraurban/home) in Google Earth Engine for data retrieval and analysis for urban risk, including urban heat and vegetation changes. It aims to simplify the most demanding processing steps and allow users to perform GIS analysis combined with the humanity dataset. More project details are [available here](https://pinkychow1010.github.io/project/2023/01/01/intraurban.html).

In recent years, the importance of digital archives has surged in historical studies, providing many scholars with easier access to resources. With my Eastern Asian background, I am aware that many academics in Chinese/ Asian studies are newbies to digital resources and programming, leading to the initiatives of this free-time project. 

I created a [blog](https://pinkychow1010.github.io/digital-chinese-history-blog/){:target="_blank"} which aims to introduce Python programming languages to people working with Chinese digital resources, with many examples and exercises in the Chinese historical context using Jupyter Notebook. Despite many free data science tutorials being available, not many of them are in the digital humanities context and working with Chinese resources. Since digital tools are not designated for Chinese languages, it poses additional challenges to the learners. My blog aims to fill this gap and offer an overview to those whose wish to start working with Chinese digital archives using Python. 

The contents I created include data visualization, Chinese NLP,  data mining and wrangling.
