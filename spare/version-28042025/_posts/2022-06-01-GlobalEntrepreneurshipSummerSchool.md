## Learning to make positive impacts

During the summer of 2022, I am glad to participate in the Global Entrepreneurship Summer School, where excellent entrepreneurs, including Prof. Muhammad Yunus, who has won the Nobel Peace Prize for his concept of social business, give lectures on establishing start-ups that make positive impacts. I have gained a lot on how to build a business model, put ideas into prototypes, as well as to gain funding from various sources.
