## University of W체rzburg: Inland Surface Water Dynamics

This project is a working contract with the Julius-Maximilians-Universit채t W체rzburg, which aims to develop a Python library for analysing surface water dynamics in Burkina Faso, West Africa, using data infrastructure from Open Data Cube, a digital tool to facilitate access to satellite imagery such as Landsat and Sentinel-1. This project is within the framework of WASCAL (West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use).

This project tested multiple spectral approaches to process the imagery accurately, including applying a novel cloud mask. Helper functions are developed to automate analysis workflow. Users can hence easily access information such as the long-term trend of water coverage and the frequency of water occurrence, computed using ingested Sentinel-2 data.
