Starting in July 2024, I joined Maya Climate, an innovative software company specializing in generative AI and geospatial intelligence for land assessment. As the lead for geospatial product development with a focus on forest conservation, I spearhead research and deploy advanced algorithms to refine our earth observation-based product catalog.

In this role, I concentrate on advancing our GIS capabilities through sophisticated spatial modeling and the scientific development of data products. My work ensures that our geospatial solutions are perfectly aligned with our business goals, driving innovation in conservation practices and promoting sustainable forest management.
