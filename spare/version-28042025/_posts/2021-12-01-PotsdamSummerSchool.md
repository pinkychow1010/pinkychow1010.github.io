## Climate Impacts on the Cryosphere

During the summer of 2021, I took part in the Potsdam Summer School, which is held virtual owing to the Covid pandemic. Under the theme "Water: Our Global Common Good – The Hydrosphere across Land and Sea", I met with different international and young professionals who work in water and disaster management. We discussed diverse topics including the role of the Arctic Council, sea ice monitoring, coastal risk screening, and the implications of the climate model (CMIP6) to the cryosphere.
