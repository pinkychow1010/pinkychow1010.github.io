  Hello there! I'm Ka Hei, a geoscientist from Hong Kong passionate about 
  geospatial data, earth observation, and machine learning. I love mountains 
  and care deeply about sustainability and AI. My research focuses on 
  climate risk, conservation, and disaster management. With experience in data science, 
  including building machine learning models and developing geospatial data products, 
  I've worked with both scientific communities and business stakeholders. Previously, 
  I was a climate risk consultant at the World Bank. I also collaborated with NGOs and 
  research institutions on projects like the Global SnowPack initiative at 
  the German Aersospace Center (DLR). In my spare time, I enjoy exploring culture, 
  cognitive psychology, and evolution.
