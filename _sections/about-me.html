   From the bustling streets of Hong Kong to the farthest corners of the world, my journey as a geospatial data engineer and geoscientist has been driven by a deep curiosity about our planet. Growing up surrounded by lush mountains and powerful nature, I developed a passion for understanding the Earth's dynamic processes. This passion has led me to explore remote sensing, machine learning, and climate science, seeking ways to use technology to create a more sustainable future.

   Today, I lead GIS product development at Maya Climate, where we harness the power of geospatial data for land assessment. Previously, as a climate risk consultant at the World Bank Group, I helped shape strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on vulnerable communities. My work is more than just data and mapsâ€”it's about telling stories of our planet and finding innovative solutions for a better tomorrow.
