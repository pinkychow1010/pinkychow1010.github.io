<p>👋 Hi! I am Ka Hei, a young geoscientist specializing in geospatial data & remote sensing. I am a mountain enthusiast and a global citizen keen on empowering local communities using machine learning, space, and AI technology. My research interests include climate resilience, water resources, and disaster management. 🌏
I began my geoscience journey in Freiburg, Germany next to the gorgeous black forest. During my exchange stay in Australia, I was fascinated by the potential of remote sensing. In 2020, I joined the EAGLE master program in cooperation with DLR-EOC motivated by my passion to use Earth Observation data and Artificial Intelligence to understand local climate impacts and facilitate better decisions for global communities. In my free time, I like to learn about different cultures, cognitive psychology and evolution.</p>
