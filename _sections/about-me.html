<p>👋 Hi! I am Ka Hei, a young geoscientist specializing in geospatial data, machine learning & remote sensing. I am a mountain enthusiast and a global citizen keen on empowering local communities using space and AI. My research interests include climate resilience, water resources, and disaster management. 🌏 My data science projects utilize supervised, unsupervised approaches, and deep learning models applied on satellite data, climate time series, and images.

I began my geoscience journey in Freiburg, Germany next to the gorgeous black forest. During my exchange stay in Australia, I was fascinated by the potential of remote sensing. In 2020, I joined the EAGLE master program in cooperation with DLR-EOC motivated by my passion to use Earth Observation data and Artificial Intelligence to understand local climate impacts and facilitate better decisions for global communities. In my free time, I like to learn about different cultures, cognitive psychology and evolution.</p>
