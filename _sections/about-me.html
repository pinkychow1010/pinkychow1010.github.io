<p>👋 Hi! I am Ka Hei, a young geoscientist from Hong Kong specializing in geospatial data, machine learning & remote sensing. I am a mountain enthusiast and a global citizen interested in space and AI. My research interests include climate resilience, water resources, and disaster management. 🌏 My data science projects utilize supervised, unsupervised approaches, and deep learning models applied on satellite data, climate time series, and images.

I began my geoscience journey in Freiburg, Germany before I dive into remote sensing in Australia. In 2020, I joined the EAGLE M.Sc. in cooperation with DLR-EOC motivated by my passion to facilitate data-driven decisions for global communities. In my free time, I like to learn about culture, cognitive psychology and evolution.</p>
