<p> Hello! I am Ka Hei, a young geoscientist from Hong Kong 
    specializing in geospatial data, earth observation and machine learning. 
    I am a mountain enthusiast and a global citizen interested in sustainability and AI. 
    My research interests include climate risk, resilience and disaster management. 
    My data science experience includes building machine learning models using EO data 
    and developing geospatial data products for scientific research communities and business audiences.

    I have cooperated with NGOs and research institutions. Currently, I am a climate risk consultant 
    working for the Poverty Reduction and Equity Group of the World Bank. 
    In my free time, I like to learn about culture, cognitive psychology and evolution.
