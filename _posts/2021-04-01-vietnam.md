This project aims to effectively detect unofficial open dumps from optical remote sensing imagery (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) using Google Earth Engine. It completes the following tasks:

1) Classification of dumping sites using visual and thermal bands

2) Development of methane proxy from multi-spectral data (Multi-band–single-pass (MBSP) retrieval and adapted Single-band–multi-pass (SBMP) retrieval)

3) Tasseled Cap Analysis
