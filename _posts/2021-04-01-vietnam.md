## WWF Germany: Detecting Open Dumps on Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam

This project is a collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) which aims to explore the potential of detecting unofficial open dumps from space. In Vietnam, since most of the solid waste (73.5 %) is deposited in open dump sites, large quantities of waste are discharged into the environment daily, contaminating the soil and water resources. The geoinformation is nonetheless unavailable. This project hence aims to provide a solution for harvesting the potential of EO data and cloud computing.

Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical imagery are used as inputs in Google Earth Engine, to construct a machine learning classifier using visual and thermal bands. Tasselled Cap Analysis is performed, as well as the development of two methane proxies using Multi-bandâ€“single-pass (MBSP) and adapted Single-bandâ€“multi-pass (SBMP) retrieval. The algorithms are tested on Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam, where field data is available.
