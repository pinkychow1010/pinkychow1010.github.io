Starting in July 2024, I joined Maya Climate, a software company specializing in generative AI and geospatial intelligence for land assessment. As the lead for geospatial product development with a focus on forest conservation, I conduct research and implement algorithms to support our earth observation-based product catalog. My role involves enhancing GIS capabilities through spatial modeling and the scientific development of data products, ensuring alignment with business goals and optimizing the data pipeline.
