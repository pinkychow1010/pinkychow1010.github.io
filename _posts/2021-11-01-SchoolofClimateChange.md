## Bridging Science and Governance

During the spring of 2021, I took part in the Oxford School of Climate Change, a three-month programme ran by leading academics to discuss our climate crisis and environmental action, from the perspectives of science and beyond. We dived into the narratives in the political, business, and cultural domains, addressing systematic issues related to climate change and exploring how to leverage scientific evidence to make societal impacts in the form of climate policy, renewable energy, and city resilience. The most exciting part is to meet people from all over the world from a range of backgrounds who all cared passionately about tackling climate change, from the educational, and social, to the science domains.
