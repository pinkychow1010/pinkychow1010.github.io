## Showcasing work at the World Bank

In February and March 2024, I had the opportunity to present the development of an earth observation-based climate risk toolbox in Munich and through virtual platforms. The framework of Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs) emphasizes the necessity for precise and comprehensive insights into the spatial distribution of climate risk, while also integrating social demographic data.

During these presentations, I elucidated on the utilization of high-resolution remote sensing data within national climate risk assessments, facilitated by the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). This integration empowers users to effectively assess updated information through an intuitive interface, ensuring streamlined decision-making processes.

The toolbox offers a wealth of information, including analyses of land cover changes, relative wealth statistics, impacts of urban heat islands, and historical heatwave events. These insights provide stakeholders with a holistic understanding of climate risks, enabling informed planning and mitigation strategies.
