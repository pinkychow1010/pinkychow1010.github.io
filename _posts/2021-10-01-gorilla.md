## Home Range Analysis of Mountain Gorillas in Rwanda

This project aims to analyze the home ranges of multiple Gorilla groups monitored with portable GNSS sensors in an automated manner. It utilizes R Raster, sf for the spatial analysis, ggplotly for plotting, Shiny and flexdashboard for the dashboard building and adehabitatHR for home range model estimation. The end product features the visualization of group dynamics in an interactive map with statistics which can be downloaded by users.
