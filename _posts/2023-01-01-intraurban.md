In 2023, I joined the World Bank Group as a climate risk consultant within the Poverty Reduction and Equity Group. Our focus was on the Pakistan Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR), where we emphasized the necessity of thorough national climate risk analysis using earth observation data and human-centric datasets.

During my work, I automated the existing climate risk analysis workflow using Google Earth Engine cloud computing. Through this, I developed an interactive dashboard for analysis, establishing a pioneering global analysis framework that integrates earth observation data with societal datasets.

These analyses unveiled societal and environmental shifts alongside climate hazards like urban heat islands, deforestation, and recent urbanization trends. The framework empowered users, regardless of local data availability or programming skills, to easily conduct computationally intensive assessments, such as modeling land surface temperature changes or vegetation dynamics over recent decades.
