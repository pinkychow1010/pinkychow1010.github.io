## Water Quality Assessment based on MODIS daily product

In this project, I explored the potential of MODIS in evaluating inland water quality in the global scale. Although there have been extensive research in investigating phenomena such as algae bloom, the study are mostly in local scale. This project examine water quality in two dimensions: Turbidity and eutrophication. Diverse spectral indices are tested in the global scale  using Google Earth Engine. One focused case is in Tai Lake, China, where field data from the research stations are available. The output of this project is a decision tree classifier, where water pixels are classified into 5 classes in each dimension.
