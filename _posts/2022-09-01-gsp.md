## DLR contract: Developing Software for VIIRS sensor

In this 8-month project, I independently developed a geospatial data product of snow avalanche hazards from scratch. This baseline model considers long-term climate averages to assess avalanche hotspots worldwide, including estimating the mass flux extent.

The main challenges lie in the huge input quantity (0.5 TB) and the unscalability of the existing methodology, where global implementation is not feasible. For resolution, the approach is modified and fully automated using a data pipeline. To do so, I have performed a detailed literature review on existing methodology and developed algorithms tailored to the business needs and resource constraints. The workflow is thoroughly tested, documented for continuous development and validated using very-high-resolution satellite imagery. The end product is a gridded dataset with global coverage and 30-meter spatial resolution, which is applied on the in-house climate risk intelligence platform.
