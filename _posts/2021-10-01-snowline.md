## DLR contract: Landsat-based Analysis of Snowline Elevation Dynamics

This project is a work contract with the DLR, which aims to implement a novel approach to accurately detect long-term snow cover dynamics in the European Alps, as the previous approach is prone to errors from cloud cover. To better quantify the changes in long-term snowline elevation, I worked with Landsat imagery to develop an optimal snow classification scheme for data analysis between 1985 to 2020. 

An automated data pipeline is developed to streamline the ETL and multiclass classification processes. The optimized workflow has significantly increases the classification performance from 77.61% to 94.47%. The result of this project has been published.
