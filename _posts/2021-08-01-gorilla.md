## Home Range Analysis of Mountain Gorillas in Rwanda

I also did some home range analysis of the mountain gorillas in the national park in Rwanda. To better understand the dynamics of different gorilla groups, GPS units are used to record the daily movements of the gorillas. The collected data is used for the home rangecalculation in an automated manner. At the end, a dashboard is developed to visualize the daily walking distance, home range overlaps, and home range sizes of the groups. It utilizes R **raster**, **sf** for the spatial analysis, **ggplotly** for plotting, **Shiny** and **flexdashboard** for the dashboard building and adehabitatHR for home range model estimation. The end product features the visualization of group dynamics in an interactive map with statistics which can be downloaded by users.
