## Ororatech: Detecting Smoke Plume from VIIRS imagery

This is an internship project, where I prototyped a VIIRS-based smoke detection using spectral information from the optical imagery. Although fire can be detected in space using thermal sensor, it is prone to specific error sources and an additional smoke detector can aid fire detection in the early phase. This project tested multiple research approaches for consistent fire detection in the global scale, and developed a novel classifier to distinguish fire from cloud and dust effectively. Check out my [earth engine app](https://pinkychow1010.users.earthengine.app/view/smokedetection) for the overview.
