## Inland Water Analysis

This project aims to develop a Python library for analysing water availability in Burkina Faso, West Africa. It is a task under WASCAL (West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use) DataCube for Burkina Faso. Using the functions, users can access information such as the long-term trend of water coverage, as well as the frequency of water occurrence in an area, computed using ingested Sentinel-2 data.
