## Analysis of Snowline Elevation Dynamics using Landsat time series

Climate change influences the snowmelt dynamics in the European Alps. In order to better quantify the changes of long-term snowline elevation, I worked with Landsat imagery to develop an optimal snow classification scheme for data analysis. To process the data from 1985 to 2020, lots of issues needed to be managed, such as defeated pixels, snow confusion from clouds, and missing data. In order to effectively perform the analysis, I developed a data pipeline to transform raw formats to multiclass classification. The automated workflow also significantly increases the classification performance from 77.61% to 94.47%. The result of this project is planned to be published.
