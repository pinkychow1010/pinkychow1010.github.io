## The Ice-flow motion of Priestley Glacier, East Antarctica


Previously, I worked with collected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data from the Priestley Glacier, East Antarctica. I tried to find out the performance of different online GNSS processing tools and roles of ocean tides.

My Research Questions:

1) What are the accuracy and uncertainty of the tested GNSS processing tools?

2) In what extent does GNSS PPP (Precise Point Positioning) outperform DGNSS (Differential GNSS)?

3) How do ocean tides influence ice flow velocity, both horizontally and vertically, at the floating ice shelf and ice sheet behind the grounding line?

The study tries to answer them by performing Fast Fourier Transform and bootstrapping of the data at the base station, as well as Singular Spectrum Analysis of the time series. The analysis is performed in Python, mainly using Pandas, but also NumPy, Seaborn, Pymssa, Scipy, and Statsmodels for statistical analysis and data visualization.
