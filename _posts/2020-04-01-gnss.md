## Universität Tübingen: Analysing Ice-flow motion of Priestley Glacier, East Antarctica

This is my thesis project in 2020, where I processed the collected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data from the Priestley Glacier, East Antarctica, to statistically test out the performance of different processing tools. Besides, I tried to extract ocean tides from the ice flow movement.

The research questions are: 
- What are the accuracy and uncertainty of the GNSS processing tools and schemes?
- How do ocean tides influence ice flow velocity at the floating ice shelf and ice sheet behind the grounding line?

Multiple analysis are performed using Fast Fourier Transform, bootstrapping, and singular spectrum analysis of the time series. The project is mainly performed in Python using Pandas, but also NumPy, Seaborn, Pymssa, Scipy, and Statsmodels for statistical analysis and data visualization.
