## The Ice-flow motion of Priestley Glacier, East Antarctica

In my Bachelor's thesis, I worked with GNSS field data from the Priestley Glacier, East Antarctica, trying to find out:

1) What are the accuracy and uncertainty of different online GNSS processing tools?

2) How does DGNSS (Differential GNSS) and GNSS PPP (Precise Point Positioning) perform respectively?

3) How do ocean tides influence ice flow velocity, both horizontally and vertically, at the floating ice shelf and ice sheet behind the grounding line?

The study tries to answer them by performing Fast Fourier Transform and bootstrapping of the data at the base station, as well as Singular Spectrum Analysis of the time series. The analysis is performed in Python, mainly using Pandas, but also NumPy, Seaborn, Pymssa, Scipy, and Statsmodels for statistical analysis and data visualization.
