## Meeting professionals for EO Applications

In May 2022, we took the train from WÃ¼rzburg to Bonn, the former capital of West Germany, to join the Living Planet Symposium, one of the largest of its kind where scientists discuss findings on our blue planet derived from satellite imagery. Meanwhile, many EO enterprises participate to share their insights on how to leverage open data to make impacts toward a sustainable future and resilient society. Here I learnt fruitful lessons on diverse topics such as novel Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) applications, interdisciplinary projects on peatland conservation, as well as future challenges in data commercialization. In the agricultural policy session, I presented my work on predicting locust outbreaks in Ethiopia using Landsat and climate reanalysis dataset. We shall see EO data not only as a way to keep track of anthropogenic and climate impacts, but it's also as a highly powerful and beneficial tool for effective mitigation on a global scale. With the right skills and tools, we would hence explore the EO potentials and make near-real-time and scalable impacts.
